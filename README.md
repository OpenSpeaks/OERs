# OERs
Open Educational Resources (OERs) are one of the major components of OpenSpeaks as the project aims at collaborating with other contributors and build user manuals and other documentations. These resources help newbies to learn about different processes that are part of the digital documentation OpenSpeaks aims to create for any language.

OpenSpeaks lays out a simpler workflow that one needs to go through to fully record various aspects in their language. The workflow is partly human and partly technical. The human process focuses on building a human connection between the interviewer and the interviewee that helps better capture the nuances of a language in the most natural form. The technical process focuses on three major aspects:
 a. hardware components and settings to capture audio/video
 b. software required for recording
 c. overall recording, editing and publishing process
