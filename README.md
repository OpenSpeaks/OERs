# OERs
### OVERVIEW
Open Educational Resources (OERs) are one of the major components of OpenSpeaks as the project aims at collaborating with other contributors and build user manuals and other documentations. OpenSpeaks being a digital documentation toolkit project is all about helping anyone who is interested to digitally-document different aspects in any language. The process includes video/audio recording, curating metadata, annotation and publication of the recorded content. These resources help newbies to learn about different processes that are part of the digital documentation OpenSpeaks aims to create for any language.

### LAYERS
OpenSpeaks lays out a simpler [workflow](https://openspeaks.com/toolkits/av/#Workflow) that one needs to go through to fully record various aspects in their language. The workflow is partly human and partly technical. The human process focuses on building a [human connection](https://openspeaks.com/toolkits/av/#Interview_process) between the interviewer and the interviewee that helps better capture the nuances of a language in the most natural form. The technical process focuses on three major aspects:<br>
 a. hardware components and settings to capture audio/video<br>
 b. software required for recording<br>
 c. overall recording, editing and publishing process<br>
 d. [metadata collection and curation](https://openspeaks.com/toolkits/av/#Metadata)<br>
 
 ### TASKS
 * If you are contributor translator, then you can help translate the main OER (Copy the code from English and create "Toolkit (fr)" where "fr" is the two letter language code for French)
 * You can translate the subtitle for the video tutorials here

### TASKS FOR SUBHASHISH
* Provide context for people that might not know some of the technical jargons in the form of a glossary
